#6.S08 Final Project

##MusicBuddy

MusicBuddy is an IoT device for musicians everywhere, but for the scope of this project, we’ll start out with a small but growing market niche: ukulele players at MIT. The device will allow musicians to tune their instrument, find other musicians to jam with, access saved songs and tablature from their personal “cloud”, and most importantly, the device will teach musicians how to play songs with chords they are unfamiliar with! MusicBuddy will have a separate hardware component that can be placed on a user’s ukulele, and will allow the user to load up a song they wish to learn. MusicBuddy will then take the chords and light them up on the ukulele itself, so the musician will be able to place their fingers on the correct frets and play away!
